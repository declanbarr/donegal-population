## Analysis of the population and dwelling occupancy/vacancy rates in Donegal

This analysis uses a .px data file from the [Irish Central Statistics Office](https://cso.ie). The data file can be found [here](https://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Database/eirestat/Profile%201%20-%20Geography/Profile%201%20-%20Geography_statbank.asp?sp=Profile%201%20-%20Geography&Planguage=0&ProductID=DB_PR1). The data is from the 2011 cenus.




### Plan
#### To do

* Code to show unique values for townlands and statistics (or is this info in the metadata?)
* Drop rows with NaNs
* Visualise the DataSet
  * by townland
  * by Statistic
  * by Data - Population > 1000 or Population < 10 etc
